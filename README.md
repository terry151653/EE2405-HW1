# EE2405-HW1

(1)how to setup and run the program
See the diagram.png in repo and connect the wire. Then run the python script first. After the OK is shown in terminal, press the reset button on the board which is writed by the main.cpp in repo.
The following steps are same as homework description. Push button, and then show the frequency, and then start generating signal when pushing the middle button.

(2) what are the results
There are 3 figures will be created, the figure 1 is the signal waveform and the corresponding FFT result which is generated from board; figure 2 is the signal waveform and the corresponding FFT result which had passed through low pass RC circuit; figure 3 is the signal waveform and the corresponding FFT result which is simulated by digit low pass filter;
