# EE2405-HW1

(1)how to setup and run the program

See the buttons diagram on homework1 page, and RC circuit in link on homework page, and pins declaration in main.cpp to connect the wire. Then run the python script. After the OK is shown in terminal, press the reset button on the board which is written by the main.cpp in repo.

The following steps are same as homework description. Push button, and then show the frequency, and then start generating signal when pushing the middle button.

(2) what are the results

Three figures will be created. The figure 1 contains the signal waveform and the corresponding FFT result which is generated from board; figure 2 contains the signal waveform and the corresponding FFT result which had passed through low pass RC circuit; figure 3 contains the signal waveform and the corresponding FFT result which is simulated by digit low pass filter.
